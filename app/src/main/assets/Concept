This game is about adaptation

everything begin in a lab when someone broke a test box with a special fly inside.
this one being a vibration one break pretty much all other fly containement glass.

=> at first the flies are unwanted, unadapted. just a raw mess on this world
=> graphicaly it's represented by round flies on a squared world
=> gameplay wise the flies are divers and numerous
=>flies can only be killed (existance/deny)

=> second part is selection of the fittest
=> less but more specifique/powerfull flies
=> flies have an impact on decors -> destruction
=> capture allowed (seek recognition/acknowledgement)

=> third part socialization
=> flies now work by group with potential leader
=> each level you can use a fly to help you (looking for it's place, species persistence/usage)
=> fly now use an change their environment -> round nest

=> fourth inclusion
=> small chapter to help a fly colony against another one
=> symbiose

at the end flies have a fully matured cultural evolution they totally adapted to their environement => squared nest with round corner
but the human also accepted this new entities in the world and let them take part of it together (symbiose)


=> new mode unlocked after third part is the map domination using google map
=> allowing async pvp fight/own nests management/ressources hunt+collect/ rare fly capture and more
